    Muhammad Taha reported the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) as
    saying:
    <strong>The best day on which the sun has risen is Friday;</strong> <br> on it
    <em>Adam was created.</em> <br> <br>  On it he was made to enter Paradise, on it he
    was expelled from it. And the last hour will take place on no day other
    than Friday.
  </p>
